== Jabber Client

This is a rails app that operates as a Jabber client using
Jabber::Simple and will message asynchronously back to the
browser.  It should ultimately evolve into a full featured
AJAX Jabber client built in Rails.

It uses Juggernaut for messaging back to the browser.

== To install it

1) cp config/jabber_client_test_login.rb.template config/jabber_client_test_login.rb
2) modify it so it has the client info that will be used to receive messages and presence updates.
3) signup for a user.
4) fill out your jabber login/password (this will be used to send messages).

I'm aware that the above is quirky and unsuitable for any real usage, but it's a nice start.

== To test it

1) Launch the juggernaut server with:
     juggernaut -c config/juggernaut.yml 

2) Launch the jabber connection proxy

3) visit /buddy_list (you'll need a user with a jabber user, and you have to be logged in)

4) open up a script/console session and type:
     g = JabberUpdater.new
     g.handle_presence_updates
     FIXME: Right now you might need to run these lines, ^C to get out, and run them again for it to work.
