== Jabber Client

This is a rails app that operates as a Jabber client using
Jabber::Simple and will message asynchronously back to the
browser.  It should ultimately evolve into a full featured
AJAX Jabber client built in Rails.

It uses Juggernaut for messaging back to the browser.

== To test it

1) Launch the juggernaut server with:
     juggernaut -c config/juggernaut.yml 

2) visit /buddy_list (you'll need a user with a jabber user, and you have to be logged in)

3) open up a script/console session and type:
     g = JabberUpdater.new
     g.handle_presence_updates
     FIXME: Right now you might need to run these lines, ^C to get out, and run them again for it to work.
