	* Added TestCases for Cron Triggers, Meta Workers and stuff. We are heading towards proper code coverage with specs.

	* Added preliminary support for starting a worker on demand through scheduler. What it means is, when you have a worker which is getting
	scheduled very less frequently and you don't want the worker to persist, you can ask BackgrounDRb to restart the worker on each schedule.

	* Fixed some unreported issues with writing data to socket between workers and stuff.

	* Fixed issues with too many open connections, because connections were not getting closed. BackgrounDRb now opens only one connection, which is 
	reused throughout the lifecycle of rails application.

	* Fixed all outstanding issues with Cron triggers, BackgrounDRb now explicitly depends on "chronic" gem.

	* Removed Framework directory and BackgrounDRb now explicitly depends on packet gem.
