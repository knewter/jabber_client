Description:
    The worker generator creates stubs for a new BackgrounDRb worker.

    The generator takes a worker name as its argument.  The worker name may be
    given in CamelCase or under_score and should not be suffixed with 'Worker'.

    The generator creates a worker class in lib/workers and a test suite in
    test/unit.

Example:
    ./script/generate worker Tail

    This will create an Tail worker:
        Model:      lib/workers/tail_worker.rb
        Test:       test/unit/tail_worker_test.rb
