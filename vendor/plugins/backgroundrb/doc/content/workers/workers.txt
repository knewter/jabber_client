Workers are your building blocks of Asynchronous Task Processing. An empty auto generated worker looks like this:

<pre class="multiline">class BillingWorker < BackgrounDRb::MetaWorker
  set_worker_name :billing_worker
  def create(args = nil)
    # method gets called, when new instance of worker is created.                      
  end
end </pre>

@set_worker_name@ will set the worker name which can be later used while invoking tasks on the worker.
@create@ method gets called when worker is loaded for the first time. If you are starting your worker 
from rails, you can pass arguments to @create@ method using:

<pre class="multiline">MiddleMan.new_worker(:worker => :billing_worker,\
     :job_key => user_session,:data => current_user.id) </pre>

p(sub-title). Using Workers

You can invoke random tasks on workers from rails or you can schedule them using config file. Look into
"Scheduling":/scheduling/index.html section for scheduling and "Rails Integration":/rails/index.html section
for invoking worker tasks from rails.

p(sub-title). Inbuilt instance methods available in your workers:

*(content_list) @register_status@ : Can be used to store random results from worker which can be later retrieved from rails. For example:
  <pre class="boxed"> register_status(:order_processing => 60) </pre>
* @add_timer@ : Look in scheduler section
* @add_periodic_timer@ : Look in scheduler section
* @thread_pool@ : Look below
* @connect@: Look in "Advanced":/advanced/index.html section. Used to connect to external TCP/IP servers.
* @start_server@: Look in "Advanced":/advanced/index.html section. Used to start TCP/IP server from worker.
* @send_data@: Can be used to send objects to master process. You can ignore this method.

p(sub-title). Options via class methods :

Following class methods are available for further tuning of workers:

*(content_list) @pool_size@ : Can be used to control thread pool size. Accepts pool size as integer value.
* @set_no_auto_load@ : Can be used to disable auto loading of workers when _BackgrounDRb_ starts. Accepts true or false.
* @reload_on_schedule@ : Can be used to enable reloading of worker at scheduled execution time. Accepts true or false.
* @set_worker_name@ : Can be used to set worker name. Accepts symbol as worker name.

Following snippet demonstrates their usages:

<pre class="multiline">class HelloWorker < BackgrounDRb::MetaWorker
  set_worker_name :hello_worker
  reload_on_schedule true
  pool_size 10
end</pre>

When @reload_on_schedule@ is true, worker won't be loaded while _BackgrounDRb_ starts and hence you don't need
@set_no_auto_load@ option there.

p(sub-title). Using Thread Pool

Remember _BackgrounDRb_ follows event model of network programming, but sad truth of life is not all networking 
libraries follow this model and hence they make use of blocking IO and threads. BackgrounDRb allows you to run 
all such tasks concurrently in threads which are internally managed by BackgrounDRb thread pool.

Each worker has access to object @thread_pool@ which can be used to run task in a thread concurrently.

<pre class="boxed">thread_pool.defer(wiki_scrap_url) { |wiki_url| scrap_wikipedia(wiki_url) }</pre>

So whatever task you specify within @scrap_wikipedia@ is going to run concurrently.

*WARNING*: You shouldn't try to use @register_status@ method from within the block supplied to defer. 
Because, if you do that, you can get corrupted result hashes. However, if you are confident, 
you should wrap your status_hash ( or whatever data type, you are going to store as a status ) in a 
mutex and then use @register_status@ . It would make sure that, only one thread resisters status at a time. 

p(sub-title). Storing result/status objects

All workers can log their results with master using @register_status@ method. This status can be then
queried from rails using @ask_status@. For example:

<pre class="multiline">class ProgressWorker < BackgrounDRb::MetaWorker
  set_worker_name :progress_worker
  def create
    @counter = 0
    add_periodic_timer(2) { increment_counter }
  end
  def increment_counter
    @counter += 1
    register_status(@counter)
  end
end</pre>

And using @MiddleMan@ proxy, you can keep querying the status of progress bar :

<pre class="boxed">MiddleMan.worker(:progress_worker).ask_status</pre>

%(entry-title)<a href="testing">Testing Workers </a>%

_BackgrounDRb_ comes with a baked in mechanism to write test cases. First make sure that you 
have bdrb_test_helper.rb in the test directory of your rails app (run @rake backgroundrb:setup@, if you dont have one).

Just put your worker test cases in test/unit directory of your rails application and require the helper. Now, you should be good to go. 

<pre class="multiline">require File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__) + "/../bdrb_test_helper")
require "god_worker"
 context "When god worker starts" do
  setup do
    god_worker = GodWorker.new
  end
end </pre>

All above helper file does is that it stubs out, relevant worker methods, which really need network IO. 
There can be methods added, which aren't stubbed, for all such methods you are encouraged to stub them and send 
the patch to the backgroundrb mailing list.
