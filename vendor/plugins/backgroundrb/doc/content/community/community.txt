_BackgrounDRb_ has been brought to you by, "Hemant Kumar":http://gnufied.org with help of folks
from Ruby and Ruby on Rails community. _BackgrounDRb_ was an original idea of "Ezra Zygmuntowicz":http://brainspl.at .

Today it pulls in ideas from "EventMachine":http://eventmachine.rubyforge.org , "Twisted":http://twistedmatrix.com .
