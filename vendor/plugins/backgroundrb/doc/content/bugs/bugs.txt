Since _BackgrounDRb_ has feature of thread pools, which allows users to execute tasks
concurrently, we are using @allow_concurrency = true@ in @ActiveRecord@ model objects.
This has been known to create some issues with Oracle database Adapters. If you are sure of
what you are doing and don't need thread pool feature, you can go ahead and remove @allow_concurrency = true@
from _BackgrounDRb_ code and it should work.
