Each worker comes with an Event loop of its own and can potentially do lots of fancy stuff. Two noteworthy methods are:

<pre class="multiline">connect(ip,port,Handler)
start_server(ip,port,Handler) </pre>

If you are familiar with the EventMachine or Twisted style of network programming, the above methods allow you to
start tcp servers inside your workers or let you connect to external tcp servers. For Each accepted client or
connected socket, an instance of Handler class would be created and integrated with main event loop.
This can be used for worker to worker communication between backgroundrb servers running on two machines.

p(sub-title). @BackgrounDRb::MetaWorker#connect@ :

@connect@ lets you connect to an external TCP Server and integrates the connection within reactor loop
of worker. For example:

<pre class="multiline">class TimeClient
  def receive_data(p_data)
    worker.get_external_data(p_data)
  end

  def post_init
      p "***************** : connection completed"
  end
end

class FooWorker < BackgrounDRb::MetaWorker
  set_worker_name :foo_worker
  def create(args = nil)
    external_connection = nil
    connect("localhost",11009,TimeClient) { |conn| external_connection = conn }
  end
  def get_external_data(p_data)
    puts "And external data is : #{p_data}"
  end
end </pre>

p(sub-title). @BackgrounDRb::MetaWorker#start_server@ :

Above method allows you to start a tcp server from your worker, all the accepted connections are integrated with event loop of worker.

<pre class="multiline"> class TimeServer

   def receive_data(p_data)
   end

   def post_init
     add_periodic_timer(2) { say_hello_world }
   end

   def connection_completed
   end

   def say_hello_world
     p "***************** : invoking hello world #{Time.now}"
     send_data("Hello World\n")
   end
 end

 class ServerWorker < BackgrounDRb::MetaWorker
   set_worker_name :server_worker
   def create(args = nil)
     # start the server when worker starts
     start_server("0.0.0.0",11009,TimeServer) do |client_connection|
       client_connection.say_hello_world
     end
   end
 end </pre>
